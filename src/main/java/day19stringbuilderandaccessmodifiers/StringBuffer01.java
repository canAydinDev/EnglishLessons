        StringBuffer is another Class and way to create a String in java
        StringBuffer is very similar with StringBuilder Class, I mean both are mutable

        What is the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
        1)StringBuffer was created before StringBuilder in java
        2)StringBuffer is "multi-thread", but StringBuilder is not.
